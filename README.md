# Shop-til-you-drop

## Description

The purpose of this project was to build a working back end for an e-commerce site. To do this we will use a working Express.js API and configure it with Sequelize to sync with the MySQL database. I have thus far completed the models as well as associations for the models. It is a work in progress and the routes will be completed shortly. Walkthrough videos will be included once completed.
